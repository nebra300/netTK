# netTK

netTK is a project that offers the same features as NetLogo enviorment which uses Logo programing language. NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment, as
such, the .NET version netTK offers users the same features as the Logo version.

It is created in .NET framework using the C# language for the ability to use the .NET codebase as well as Intellisense which is sorely lacking in Logo programing language.

The project also uses OpenGL graphics library to ofload the rendering process to the GPU allowing users to focus on the algorithm or project they are currently working on
without sacrificing CPU power which is better used for said algorithams and projects.
