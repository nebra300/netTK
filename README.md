# netTK

netTK is a project that offers the same features as netLogo framework which uses Logo programing language. Those features include the ability to test algorithams and A.I. projects.

It is created in .NET framework using the C# language for the ability to use the .NET codebase as well as Intellisense which is sorely lacking in Logo programing language.

The project also uses OpenGL graphics library to ofload the rendering process to the GPU allowing users to focus on the algorithm or project they are currently working on
without sacrificing CPU power which is better used for said algorithams and projects.
